This repository contains a Groovy code example showcasing an exception handling issue within closures.  The `bug.groovy` file demonstrates the problem: an exception thrown inside the closure is not caught by the surrounding method, causing the code after the closure execution to be skipped.  The `bugSolution.groovy` file provides a solution by using a `try-catch` block to gracefully handle potential exceptions within the closure.
